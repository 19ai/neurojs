# neurojs - A machine learning framework for the browser
- Implements a full-stack neural-network based machine learning framework
- Extended reinforcement-learning support
	+ Uniform and prioritised replay buffers
	+ Advantage-learning (increasing the action-gap) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04860v1.pdf
	+ Support for **deep-q-network** and **actor-critic** models (via deep-deterministic-policy-gradients)
- Binary import and export of network configurations (weights etc.)
- Hight-performance

# Examples
- [Self-driving car](/janhuenermann/neurojs/tree/master/examples/cars)
- [Advanced XOR](/janhuenermann/neurojs/tree/master/examples/adv-xor)
- [Karpathy's Waterworld](/janhuenermann/neurojs/tree/master/examples/waterworld)

# Blog post
I wrote a blog post about this framework with an interactive car-demo embeded [on my blog](http://lab.janhuenermann.de/article/learning-to-drive#car-container), check it out!
